# Indian COVID-19 Data Exploration with Jupyter Notebook and SciPy

This Jupyter notebook presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Indian COVID-19 data sourced from Our World in Data. The study period spans from January 30, 2020, to October 21, 2021 and delves into factors potentially impacting the course of the pandemic.

### Key Objectives:

* Analyze the relationship between mortality and date: This investigation aims to evaluate whether vaccination campaigns influenced the downward trend in mortality rate.
* Explore correlations among key variables: The analysis examines the interactions between variables like total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, population, and mortality.

### Technologies:

* Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment for data exploration and visualization.
* SciPy: Leverages statistical and data processing functionalities for analysis and correlation calculations.


### Data Exploration Steps:

* Data Loading and Cleaning: Import the dataset, handle missing values, and perform basic data cleaning tasks.
* Visualization and Descriptive Statistics: Generate visualizations like time series plots and histograms to understand the data distribution and temporal trends. Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for key variables.
* Mortality Analysis: Focus on the relationship between mortality and date, potentially employing rolling averages and comparing pre- and post-vaccination periods.
* Correlation Analysis: Calculate and visualize the correlation coefficients between total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, population, and mortality. Interpret the results to identify potential associations between variables.
* Conclusions and Insights: Summarize the key findings and discuss the possible implications for understanding the dynamics of the Indian COVID-19 pandemic.
